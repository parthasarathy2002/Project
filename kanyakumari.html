Kanniyakumari is a special destination in many different ways. It is the southernmost tip of the mainland of India. Three major water bodies – the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean – converge right here in Kanniyakumari. Such a geographically blessed destination is rare and these features make Kanniyakumari  one of the most visited places in India annually.

<h4 class="data2">
The place gets its name from the Hindu goddess Devi Kanniyakumari, who is considered to be the sister of Lord Krishna. When the Dutch East India Company conquered Portuguese Ceylon from the Portuguese East Indies, the name Kanniyakumari was shortened to Comorin. Eventually during the British regime in India, the destination began to be called Cape Comorin. Later, the Government of India renamed it as Kanniyakumari.

An enduring symbol of a dynasty that once ruled over the region and a splendid tourism hotspot now visited by tourists from all over the world – Vattakottai Fort is not just a remnant of an empire, but also a source of great fascination.<br><br>
As we delve deep into history, we can see that many empires used to build forts with their security in mind. Often, these forts acted as advantage points during battles and prevented the easy advance of enemies. Vattakottai Fort is one such majestic fort constructed with coastal defense in mind during the reign of the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore in the region. One of the last seaside forts built by Travancore, Vattakottai is renowned for its splendiferous beauty and historic importance.<br><br>
The beauty of this fort that overlooks the majestic sea is a sight to behold. That is why Vattakottai Fort is a must-explore experience on your tour to Kanniyakumari.
