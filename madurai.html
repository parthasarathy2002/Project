History stays awake in this destination and the sprawling urban centre that Madurai is, offers you all the conveniences you will love for a comfortable stay. The earliest references of Madurai can be traced back to the 3rd century BC.

Referred to as the ‘Athens of the East’ due to the lofty towers of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple just like the Greek Pantheon, the city finds reference in many literary works of Arabs, Romans and Greek travellers like Megasthenes. Madurai also finds a place in ‘Silapathigaram’, a Sangam literature work. Befittingly, Madurai was a place of scholarly importance. Ports, prodigies, scholars and critics were a part of kingly courts that ruled Madurai over the centuries. Sangam, the confluence of Tamil scholars and critics, used to regularly convene in the city up to three times a day.
