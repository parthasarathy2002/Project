The Government Botanical Garden in Ooty, spread over 55 acres, is a mesmerizing tourist site that has been attracting visitors for years. Situated about 2400 – 2500 mts above sea level, the botanical garden was established by Marquis of Tweedale in 1897 with William Graham McIvor as the architect.<br><br>
The Ooty Government Botanical Garden has a lot to offer for Nature lovers with its 600 varieties of plant species cultivated and exhibited here. The verdant lawns and the exotic varieties of flora are pleasing to the eye because they are very well maintained by the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department. The mighty Doddabetta peak can be viewed from the garden. <br><br>
Some of the enticing attractions here are the Cork tree, which is probably one of the very few of its kind in India, the paperbark tree, monkey puzzle tree, the majestic 20-million-year-old fossil tree trunk and the Toda mund or Toda hill.

There is also a garden, a mini train and an amusement park nearby. The amusement park has fun activities like a haunted house, a mirror house and horse riding, and ensures an exciting experience for children.
